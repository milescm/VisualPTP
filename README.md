# Introduction
This project was implemented in Django and Python

This project visualizes the process of 'PTP Time Synchronization' in a Linux environment.

# Environment
Python version : 3.6.9

Django version : 2.0.13 


# Precondition
You must install the virtual environment first, and then run the program.

The process of installing the virtual environment is as follows:


```
$ mkdir djangoproject
$ cd djangoproject
```

When creating a virtual environment named **'myvenv'**, execute the following command.

```
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
$ source myvenv/bin/activate 
```

If the (myvenv) prefix is prefixed to the console prompt, you can see that the virtual environment has started.
And then, Install **Django** 

```
(myvenv) ~$ pip install django~=2.0.0
```
